## Analysis Findings and Recommendations
- The quantity ordered by location shows that the United states recordes the highest quantity followed by France, I will recommend that the measure that are being put in place that make for the high sales in the USA can also be replicated in other countries and also if the peculiarity of the situation is such that the manufacturing factory is sited in the united states, this could actually have influenced the high sales recorded and so I will suggest that assembling branch can be established in countries where low sales are being reorded or reduce the product price for the other countries as to probably make up for the cosdt incurred on import duties.

-  The MSRP and unit price comaprison chart reveals that over the four years, Classic cars recorded the highest number of sales alongside the number of quantities sold and the chart reveals that for the classic cars the retailer actually put the unit price at a rate a little below the Manufacturer price recommeendation, I believe the manufacturer must have factored in the profit for each of the product and I believe this could have influenced the high ssales and quantity sold for classic cars. I will recommend that the same measures should be applied to others if it will not affect the profit made on the sales negatively.

- The sales trend shows that over the years, there have been a consistent decline in sales especially in the month of April, July and Decembe. Although, due to the nature of the product, ther are certain seasons that most customers wont feel like getting such products as casrs and all, however the consistency calls for an immediate examination of the months in question. Those months should be studoes as to why there has been a consistent decline in sales.

- The Euro shopping channel have been quite impressive with their patronage as they have been patronizing Travis at a very small days gap compared to others and also, the company is the first runner up when it comes to the best performing custoemr by sales value, discounts can be given to such company and also a deeper leve of partenrship can be established between them and Travis. This will serve as an encouragement for others.

- The product category charts reveals that Classic care are the best performing product all through the countries alongside with the customers. More of classic cars can be made availasble for sales as there is a favorable market for such.

- The charts alaso shows that the most prominent deal size is the medium deal size, I believe this will help Trevo in understanading theitt customer preferences  and also have a projetion into the probable sales that can likely be recorded in subsquent years.
